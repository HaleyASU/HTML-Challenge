# HTML-Challenge
In this project, I use Splinter and Beautiful Soup to scrape and analyze web data, extracting key elements like HTML tables and news articles. The data is organized, stored, and analyzed to identify patterns, with insights visually communicated through charts or reports. This strengthens my skills in web automation, data processing, and analysis.
